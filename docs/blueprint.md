# **App Name**: Probability Explorer

## Core Features:

- PMF Visualization: Visualize the Probability Mass Function (PMF) for the Bernoulli and Binomial distributions, providing a clear graphical representation of probabilities for different outcomes.
- Simulation Engine: Simulate a large number of Bernoulli or Binomial experiments based on user-defined parameters (n and p), demonstrating empirical probabilities derived from the simulations.
- Approximation Display: Calculate and display normal and poisson approximations to the binomial distribution; an AI tool will monitor the user selected n and p and, only when it detects those approximations may be inaccurate given those parameters, will incorporate information in the display to suggest appropriate parameters to the user.
- Parameter Adjustment: Allow users to dynamically adjust parameters such as 'n' (number of trials) and 'p' (probability of success) via range inputs, enabling immediate observation of their effect on the distributions.
- Comparative Analysis: Offer a side-by-side comparison of the theoretical PMF, simulated results, and normal/poisson approximations in a combined chart, enabling visual assessment of the accuracy of each approximation.
- Data Export: Implement a button to download the displayed data as a CSV file, allowing users to further analyze and share the results.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) for clarity and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF) to ensure visual comfort.
- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA) for interactive elements, providing a soft contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a clean, neutral and modern presentation.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent interactive elements.
- Implement a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability across devices.
- Opening animation with mathematical signs and equations on the background.
- Cursor changes to summation (sigma) sign on page.
